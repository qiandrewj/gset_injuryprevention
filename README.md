This data science project was completed as part of the Governor's School of New Jersey in Engineering & Technology at Rutgers University, 2022. Published in the 2022 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference.

It analyzes data sourced from a national athlete training program and web scraping to examine potential trends between a school district's socioeconomic profile and its average Sparta Score (a proprietary metric from Sparta Science evaluating athletic performance. This project utilizes correlation analysis using Excel and pandas as well as machine learning algorithms (random forest regressions and gradient boosting) using scikit-learn.
