Determining the Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Athletic Performance Using Machine Learning
by Zachary Hale, Mikayla Kim, Andrew Qian, Emma Savov, Ria Shah, Thea Spellmeyer
Project Mentor: Julia Ma
Advisors: June Lee, Sakshi Lende

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms (random forest regressions and gradient boosting) to analyze potential trends between a school district's socioeconomic statistics and its average Sparta Score (a proprietary metric from Sparta Science representing athletic performance)
